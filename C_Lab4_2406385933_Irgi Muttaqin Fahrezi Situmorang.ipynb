bisa gagal menangkap pola kompleks\n","- **Nilai Besar** model lebih kompleks dan mampu menangkap pola lebih rumit namun berisiko overfitting (terlalu sesuai dengan data latih)\n","\n","#### `n_estimators` (khusus Random Forest)\n","- **Fungsi** menentukan jumlah model keputusan yang akan dibangun\n","- **Nilai Kecil** pelatihan lebih cepat tapi akurasi mungkin kurang karena sedikit model

Ini karena micro averaging menghitung metrik secara keseluruhan dengan mempertimbangkan proporsi data setiap kelas, sehingga hasil perhitungan lebih mencerminkan performa model yang sesungguhnya.\n","\n","#### **Penjelasan Label Imbalance**:\n","**Label imbalance** terjadi ketika jumlah sampel di setiap kelas tidak seimbang. Misalnya, dalam sebuah dataset yang digunakan untuk mengklasifikasikan penyakit, mungkin terdapat banyak sampel kelas **sehat** tetapi sangat sedikit sampel kelas **sakit**. Kondisi ini dapat menyebabkan model cenderung memprediksi kelas yang lebih dominan dengan akurasi tinggi, namun memiliki performa yang buruk pada kelas minoritas.\n","\n","#### **Sumber Referensi**:\n","- [Scikit-learn: Classification Metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qkZEfilPp5G3"},"source":["## No.6"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"23NPSIkmqC32"},"source":["### **6.a Terdapat dua alasan mengapa decision tree tidak dapat mendapatkan leaf node yang sempurna (Contohnya di node tersebut masih terdapat data yang positif dan negatif), jika ada lebih dari 2 alasan tidak masalah. (Sertakan sumber anda)**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tZnAkypUs23M"},"source":["**Jawab Disini**\n","### **Alasan Mengapa Decision Tree Tidak Dapat Mendapatkan Leaf Node yang Sempurna**\n","\n","1. **Data Tidak Sepenuhnya Terpisah**:\n","   - Salah satu alasan utama decision tree tidak bisa mendapatkan leaf node yang sempurna adalah karena beberapa fitur atau variabel dalam dataset tidak bisa sepenuhnya memisahkan kelas secara tegas. Ini berarti pada beberapa node, masih terdapat data positif dan negatif karena ada tumpang tindih pada atribut tertentu. Fitur-fitur ini mungkin tidak memberikan cukup informasi untuk memisahkan semua kelas dengan sempurna.\n","\n","2. **Overfitting dan Batasan Regularisasi**:\n","   - Untuk menghindari **overfitting**, decision tree sering kali dilengkapi dengan mekanisme **pruning** atau batasan seperti **max depth**, **min samples split**, atau **min samples leaf**. Batasan ini bisa menghentikan tree dari tumbuh terlalu dalam, yang berarti tidak semua node akan benar-benar sempurna (hanya berisi satu kelas). Hal ini penting agar model bisa melakukan generalisasi dengan baik dan tidak hanya \"menghafal\" data latihan.\n","\n","3. **Noisy Data**:\n","   - Noisy data atau data yang mengandung kesalahan atau outlier juga menjadi alasan mengapa decision tree tidak bisa mendapatkan leaf node yang sempurna. Noise dapat menyebabkan tree membentuk split yang kurang ideal, dan meskipun leaf nodes dioptimalkan, beberapa data yang salah label atau outlier tetap akan ada di node yang salah.\n","\n","#### **Sumber Referensi**:\n","- [Scikit-learn: Decision Tree Classifier Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8GYcADEntPoh"},"source":["### **6.b Decision tree merupakan salah satu algoritma yang sangat sensitif dengan perubahan data, mengapa demikian? dan bagaimana random forest dapat menyelesaikan masalah tersebut?

Sedikit perubahan dalam data (misalnya penambahan, penghapusan, atau perubahan kecil dalam data) dapat menyebabkan decision tree membuat split yang sangat berbeda, mengakibatkan perubahan besar dalam struktur tree dan prediksi yang dihasilkan.\n","\n","2. **Pemilihan Fitur**:\n","   - Decision tree membuat keputusan berdasarkan fitur yang dipilih untuk membuat split. Jika ada data yang sedikit berubah, fitur yang terpilih untuk membuat split bisa berubah drastis, yang pada akhirnya mengubah keseluruhan struktur pohon. Hal ini membuat decision tree sangat sensitif terhadap variasi atau gangguan kecil dalam data.\n","\n","#### **Bagaimana Random Forest Mengatasi Masalah Ini**:\n","1. **Averaging dan Voting**:\n","   - Random forest mengurangi sensitivitas decision tree dengan cara membangun banyak decision tree dari subset data yang berbeda (dengan **bootstrap sampling**) dan melakukan **voting** atau **averaging** untuk menghasilkan prediksi akhir. Karena model menggabungkan hasil dari banyak pohon yang berbeda, perubahan kecil dalam satu pohon tidak akan mempengaruhi hasil secara keseluruhan.\n","\n","2. **Pengacakan Fitur (Random Feature Selection)**:\n","   - Selain itu, random forest juga menggunakan teknik **random feature selection** di mana pada setiap split, hanya subset acak dari fitur yang dipertimbangkan untuk pemisahan. Hal ini membuat model lebih tahan terhadap fluktuasi dalam data, karena pemilihan fitur tidak sepenuhnya bergantung pada fitur paling dominan yang dipilih oleh decision tree tunggal.\n","\n","#### **Kesimpulan**:\n","Random forest mengatasi kelemahan decision tree dengan cara membangun banyak pohon dari subset data yang berbeda dan melakukan pengacakan fitur, sehingga model menjadi lebih stabil dan tidak terlalu sensitif terhadap perubahan kecil dalam data.\n","\n","#### **Sumber Referensi**:\n","- [Scikit-learn: Random Forest

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n","MAE mengukur rata-rata perbedaan absolut antara nilai yang diprediksi dan nilai sebenarnya. Ini menunjukkan seberapa besar kesalahan prediksi rata-rata.\n","- **Kegunaan**, MAE berguna saat kita ingin mengetahui seberapa jauh rata-rata prediksi model dari nilai yang sebenarnya, tanpa memperhitungkan arah kesalahan.\n","- **Rumus**: Rata-rata dari |prediksi - nilai sebenarnya|.\n","\n","#### **2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n","MSE menghitung rata-rata dari kuadrat perbedaan antara nilai prediksi dan nilai sebenarnya. MSE memberikan penalti yang lebih besar untuk kesalahan prediksi yang besar.\n","- **Kegunaan**, MSE lebih sensitif terhadap outlier karena menghitung kuadrat kesalahan. Bagus untuk menghukum prediksi yang jauh dari target.\n","- **Rumus**: Rata-rata dari (prediksi - nilai sebenarnya)².\n","\n","#### **3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**\n","RMSE adalah akar kuadrat dari MSE. Ini mengubah MSE kembali ke skala asli data, sehingga lebih mudah dipahami dibandingkan dengan MSE.\n","- **Kegunaan**, RMSE sering digunakan karena menghasilkan nilai dalam skala yang sama dengan target aslinya, sehingga lebih intuitif untuk interpretasi.\n","- **Rumus**: Akar dari MSE.\n","\n","#### **4. R-Squared (R²)**\n","R² adalah metrik yang menunjukkan seberapa baik model menjelaskan variasi dalam data. Nilai R² berkisar dari 0 hingga 1, di mana 1 menunjukkan model yang sempurna.\n","- **Kegunaan**, R² berguna untuk mengukur seberapa baik model menjelaskan variansi data target.\n","- **Rumus**: 1 - (variansi yang dijelaskan oleh model / total variansi).\n","\n","---\n","\n","#### **Mengapa RMSE Lebih Sering Digunakan Dibandingkan MSE?**\n","- **Alasan**: RMSE lebih sering digunakan karena hasilnya lebih mudah diinterpretasikan, mengingat RMSE berada dalam skala yang sama dengan target data (unit aslinya). Sementara MSE memberikan nilai dalam kuadrat unit, yang sering kali sulit untuk diinterpretasikan secara langsung. Dengan kata lain, RMSE mengembalikan kesalahan ke dalam skala aslinya, sehingga lebih intuitif dan praktis saat mengevaluasi model.\n","\n","#### **Sumber Referensi**:\n","- [Scikit-learn: Regression Metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html)\n","- [Towards Data Science: Comparing Robustness of MAE, MSE and RMSE](https://towardsdatascience.com/comparing-robustness-of-mae-mse-and-rmse-6d69da870828)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9qkXvepLO_qr"},"source":["# Kaggle Competition!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CitGye_APDEI"},"source":["Dalam rangka menerapkan pemahaman kalian pada materi CART dan sebagai sarana untuk berlatih, kalian **diwajibkan** untuk mengikuti Kaggle Competition yang akan diadakan bersamaan dengan Lab 4 ini.\n","\n","**Bagaimana Cara Mengikuti?**\n","*   Kalian akan menemukan tautan ke kompetisi di bagian bawah section ini.
